            <h3>1. Kadasig Gym</h3>
            <p>The name “Kadasig” is a Cebuano term, which may be translated as enthusiasm and courage. The name hopes to inspire the users of this facility to engage in basketball and futsal games with the courage in their hearts to pursue the skills they have. Honing the students' athletic abilities and providing recreation to the CTU Danao community are the responding needs for its construction. Set in a spacious landscape and other campus sports facilities, it has two baskets on both ends and a stage. The stage is for the performing arts productions and other outdoor activities, thus making the Kadasig gym a multipurpose place.</p>
